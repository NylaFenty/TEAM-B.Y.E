	Goddess of the Cosmos README
=======================================

In the beginning, this website started as a single idea from one person who just wanted to make a website for her stepmom's small business - Goddess of the Cosmos. Goddess of the Cosmos is a small business started by Traci Harvey and Lisa Murray, which sales organic homemade skin and care products based off Cleopatra's beauty rituals. I went to visit them to gather ideas and information that is used for the website.This website will help promote their business by making it more convenient, efficient and marketable.



Entire Website: 

-The owners first created products for self use; however, friends and family noticed the difference in their skin and soon they began getting requests to make it available to others. Goddess of the Cosmos was born! 

-We chose fonts that were easy to read but also went with the style of the business.

-As for the color scheme, after doing a little research and speaking with the owners, we incorporated jewel tone colors; that were inspired by the Egyptian desert landscapes and the Nile's most precious gemstone - the emerald.  It was well known that Cleopatra loved the emeralds which stood for fertility, rebirth and hope. It also has protective and healing properties that radiate mysterious powers.

-Our website is responsive on all devices and looks great on GATEWAY PCs.

-Our logo icon was already created and borrowed to be placed on the website. It is a painting of the Goddess of the Cosmos which is the Goddess of the Universe. It also functions as our favicon.

-Combining our skill sets, we each brought something new to the table that improved our website.
